Running the testbed for sfit4.

Go in the directory <sfit-core-code/sfit4_tests>

script/run_testcases.py [--nohbin]] [--nosfit4] [--noerror]

NOTE: run_testcases.py runs only with python2.7

In every single directory hbin, sfit4 and the error script needs to run.

this can be tested for the single program by specifying the arguments above,
which cause the script to not run hbin, sfit4 or the error calculation.

But remeber, that sfit4 needs an hbin file to run.
