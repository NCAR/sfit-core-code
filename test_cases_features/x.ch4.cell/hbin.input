# Input file for hbin
#
# this reads lines delivered with the ggg version 20120409
#
# December 2013 sfit4 version 0.9.5.1
# v003.95 reserve O2 CIA at #49 - read separately
# July 2012 sfit4 version v003.92 jwh / tested p1.6
# latest tested version: d0.9.4.1 20130701
# latest tested version: d0.9.2 20130502
# first tested version: b3.999 beta
#
# these lines are comments and can be anywhere
#
# implemented in version b3.99:
# the linelist directory structure is the key to the gas names and the molecule id numbers
# those id's and names must be the same in the reference.prf file
# eg a files containing hitran lines is read from one subdir in linelist then the molid will be changed
# to the 2digit integer 0NN of the subdir name and assumed to be for gas 'abcdef' from subdir 0NN_abcdef
#
# first input: flag to print out ascii file ( FORTRAN logical T or .TRUE. or F or .FALSE. )
.FALSE.
#
# next non-comment line is a path to the directory tree where the gas subdirectories are
/data/linelist/
#
# next non-comment entry is the number of path/files to look for
6
#
# Then the next lines are paths to each gas file that will be searched for lines in the
#  desired wavenember region
# the id numbers are in sfit order - not exactly HITRAN, BUT KEEP these directory names
# the files are in HITRAN format
#
# tip: put a blank after the '/' to skip that gas or just remove it
# 049_O2CIA/o2cia_20060420.101 - this file is a special case, molid & isotope
#  ids are dealt with differently
