# Input file for hbin
# v003.991 beta
# July 2012 sfit4 version v003.92 jwh
# these lines are comments and can be anywhere
#
# implemented in version 3.99:
# the linelist directory structure is the key to the gas names and the molecule id numbers
# those id's and names must be the same in the reference.prf file
# eg a files containing hitran lines is read from one subdir in linelist then the molid will be changed
# to the 2digit integer 0NN of the subdir name and assumed to be for gas 'abcdef' from subdir 0NN_abcdef
#
# first non-comment line is a path to the directory tree where the gas subdirectories are
T
../../linelist/
#
# next entry is the number of path/files to look for
4
#
# Then the next lines are paths to each gas file that will be searched for lines in the
#  desired wavenember region
# the id numbers are in sfit order - not exactly HITRAN, BUT KEEP these directory names
# the files are in HITRAN format
# tip: put a blank after the '/' to skip that gas
