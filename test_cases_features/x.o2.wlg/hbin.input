# Input file for hbin
#
# v 0.9.5.1 - preRelease
# July 2012 sfit4 version v003.92 jwh
# these lines are comments and can be anywhere
#
# implemented in version b3.99:
# the linelist directory structure is the key to the gas names and the molecule id numbers
# those id's and names must be the same in the reference.prf file
# eg a files containing hitran lines is read from one subdir in linelist then the molid will be changed
# to the 2digit integer 0NN of the subdir name and assumed to be for gas 'abcdef' from subdir 0NN_abcdef
#
# first input: flag to print out ascii file ( FORTRAN logical T or .TRUE. or F or .FALSE. )
.TRUE.
#
# next non-comment line is a path to the directory tree where the gas subdirectories are
#/Users/jamesw/FDP/sfit/400/linelist.all/
#/Users/jamesw/FDP/sfit/400/sfit-core/linelist/
../../linelist/
#
# next non-comment entry is the number of path/files to look for
7
#
# Then the next lines are paths to each gas file that will be searched for lines in the
#  desired wavenember region
# the id numbers are in sfit order - not exactly HITRAN, BUT KEEP these directory names
# the files are in HITRAN format (at least for the first 7 parameters)
# tip: put a blank after the '/' to skip that gas
