# pspec.inp : input file for pspec.f90
#
# version V1.1 for sfit4 v0.9.5 October 1 2013
#
# pspec.f90 loops through this file and creates an ascii file with a spectra block for
# each spectrum that will be fit by sfit4 - the t15asc.4 file
# the observation lat lon and altitude are required for each spectrum
# Latitude of Observation [+N, 90 - -90]
40.038
# Longitude of Observation[+E, 0 - 360]
254.76
# Altitude of Observation [masl]
1612.0
#
# output & verbosity flags
# oflag  - output
#     = 1 output t15asc file
#     = 2 bnr file
#     = 3 both
# vflag  - verbosity
#     = 0 no output from baseline correct or zero bnr or block output for plotting
#     = 1 verbose output from bc and zeroed bnr but no blockout
#     = 2 verbose, zeroed bnr and blockout for plotting

# filter bands and regions for calculating SNR (max 100)
# noise value is calculate in the region below that is nearest to the fit microwindow
#  SNR = (Peak signal in microwindow) / noise

# number of bnr files
1
#
# each block contains at least 2 lines:
# bnr spectra file name
# roe, nterp, rflag, fflag, zflag
#
# roe - radius of earth [km]
#
# nterp -  zero fill factor
#     = 0 - skip resample & resolution degradation (regardless of sfit4.ctl:band.n.max_opd value)
#     = 1 - minimally sample at opdmax
#     > 1 - interpolate nterp-1 points upon minimal sampled spacing
#           note: OPD is taken from sfit4.ctl:band.n.max_opd value
#
# rflag - ratio flag, to ratio the spectra with another low resolution spectral file (eg spectral envelope)
#     = 0 - no ratio
#     = 1 - ratio, file is a bnr of same type as fflag below, expected to be resolution of ~10cm-1
#
# fflag - file open flag
#     = 0 for fortran unformatted file
#     = 1 for open as steam or binary or c-type file (gfortran uses stream)
#
# zflag - zero offset
#     = 0 no zero offset,
#     = 1 try w/ baselincorrect,
#     0 < z < 1 use this value,
#     = 2 use optimized 2nd polynomial fit to fully absorbed regions in 10m region
