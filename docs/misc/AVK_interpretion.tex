\section{AVK $>$ 1}

If the AVK is greater than one, it does not mean, it is getting more
information from the measurement than when the AVK is $1$, but the
measurement looses influcence again. This can be seen when reordering using the equation
\begin{equation}
  \hat{x} = (I - A) x_a + A x_T
\end{equation}
where $x_T$ is the true variable and $\hat{x}$ is the derived
estimation of the quantity $x$. Clearly, if the AVK $A$ is the unity
matrix, $\hat{x}$ is solemly determined by the measurement. However,
if $A$ is the scaled (scale
$>$ 1) unity matrix, the estimated result is only partially
determined by the measurement. For getting a really large $A$ it has
only 50 \% influence.
