SFIT4 can use extra lineshape and linemixing parameters.

The matching of the lines is done via quantum numbers. They can be found
in the ordinary HITRAN files as the upper and lower quantum numbers (see HITRAN documentation)

Note: all the files have to be consistent. That means, if you use additional parameters you have to use the following files:

H2O
01_DLR_2016.par
01_DLR_2016_lm1st.par
01_DLR_2016_sdv.par

CO2
02_hit08_f53.par
002_CO2/02_hit08_f53_LM1ST.par
np sdv

CO
05_hit12.par
05_hit12_lm1st.par
05_hit12_sdv.par

CH4
06_kit15_2015-12-08_v1.par
06_kit15_2015-12-08_lm1st.par
06_kit15_2015-12-08_sdv.par

If other spectroscopy is used, e.g. HITRAN 16 or atm files, is is unlikely that the additional parameters work.


The format is as follows

SDV parameters:
            
i2,i1,a60,1x,f6.5,f5.4,f3.2,f8.6,1x,g15.6

Example one line of CH4 SDV parameters:

isotope number and quantum numbers                            
61    0 0 0 2 1F2    0 0 0 0 1A1   11E   2        12E   1     .04730.0640.40-.005968 0.124200E-01

the first for auxiliary numbers are just the Voigt line parameters, only the last number is the narrowing parameter used
in the calculation of the SDV lineshape.


1st order line mixing parameters

The format is free starting with the character 63. The last two characters are used by Frank Hase to model the temperature
dependency of the linemixing parameter. If they are missing, only the first parameter is used as the y-factor.

Example one line of CH4 1st order (Rosenkrantz) line mixing parameters:

61    0 0 0 2 1F2    0 0 0 0 1A1   12F1  4        13F2  3       0.150E+00 -0.165E+01  0.000E+00
