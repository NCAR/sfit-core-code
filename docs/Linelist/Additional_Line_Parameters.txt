SFIT4 can use extra lineshape and linemixing parameters.

The format is as follows

SDV parameters:

MOL# ISO# Quantum states TMP TMP TMP TMP GAMMA_2

i2,i1,a60,1x,f6.5,f5.4,f3.2,f8.6,1x,g15.6

Example one line of CH4 SDV parameters:

isotope number and quantum numbers                            
61    0 0 0 2 1F2    0 0 0 0 1A1   11E   2        12E   1     .04730.0640.40-.005968 0.124200E-01

the first four auxiliary numbers (denoted by TMP) are just the Voigt
line parameters and not used, only the last number is the narrowing
parameter used in the calculation of the SDV lineshape.


1st order line mixing parameters

The format is free starting with the character 61. The last two
characters are used by Frank Hase to model the quadratic temperature
dependency of the linemixing parameter. If they are missing, only the
first parameter is used as the y-factor.

Example one line of CH4 1st order (Rosenkrantz) line mixing parameters:

61    0 0 0 2 1F2    0 0 0 0 1A1   12F1  4        13F2  3       0.150E+00 -0.165E+01  0.000E+00

GALATRY parameters

The Galatry parameters are taken from HITRAN when available and formatted
according to SFIT4. The format for the Galatry parameters ist:

mol/isot        v'             v"                branch J"     gam_air narrowing
141             13             12                    P  2       0.0897 0.0391

The extra parameter for the Galatry function is named narrowing.
