NOTE:

voigt_sdv_lm

seems not to work for sdv alone (not lm, or shift set to zero)


Auxiliary data implemented so far are

1st order limixing parameters, temperatur dependence acc Frank Hase

from col 63 three numbers:

y-parameter (YLM), T1(LMTK1), T2(LMTK2)

the y factor is calculated by

LMTVAL = (T(K) - 260.0D0) / 60.0D0 ! LM-REF TEMPERATURES: 200/260/320 K
SDVLM_PARAM(4) = YLM(N) * (1.0D0 + LMTVAL *(LMTK1(N) + LMTVAL * LMTK2(N)))


SDV

SDV parameter in code multiplied by g0_air.
