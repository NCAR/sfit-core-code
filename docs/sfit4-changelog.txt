version v0.6

- many bugfixes in the output files

new features

sfit4

- inclusion of the transmission curvature possible (fw.transmission = T)
- new lineshapes (Tran line shape, fw.lineshape = 4)
- line mixing first order (fw.lineshape = 4, fw.linemixing = T), only if line mixing data are available
- sdv lineshape (fw.lineshape = 4, fw.lineshape.sdv = T), only if sdv parameters are available
- absorbing layer in emission calculation (fw.emission=T, fw.continuum = T, see sfit4_init for more details)

hbin

- input files can be tag = value, old format is still read in too
- inclusion of additional line parameters (linemixing 1st order, line narrowing, additional parameters for pCqHDC lineshape)
