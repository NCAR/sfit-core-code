**Change Log for SFIT4, Linelist, Documentation & auxiliary codes**

--------------------
Nov 2018 -jwh
working version 0.9.6 from MP, leading to release of V1.0 in 2019

added CFC's to molcparam, vibfcn
   - Used data from H Nakajima &  M. Takeda for F134A, CHF3, CCL3F, CCL2F2, COCL2, F141B
   - removed ch3cnpl & c2h6pl as separate species. For C2H6 lines from Harrison have superseded these and
      we no longer need to specify a separate species for testing different linelists.  CH3CN also has HIT lines
      but needs to be tested.
      - checked iso # and mode #'s

added HITRAN16 and ATM2018 line lists
   - edited gggmol and hitmolf90 codes to parse out combined ATM and HIT line list files to individual gases
   - used 160 char for all lists to include quanta data.
   - moved individual files to linelist.all for testing (not in release yet)
   - edited hbin to accommodate new isotopes
   - edited mol id map in hitran.f90
   - added Linelist_Map.xlsx into linelist directory to keep track of lines available.
   - increase value buffer in binput_4_0 and downstream from 2048 to 4096 for linelist filenames
   - completed initial test of both full HIT16 & ATM18

added TIPS 2017
   - edited lineparam and xsection for testing
   - changed debug prints in xsection for better comparisons with TIPS & VIBFCN
   - edited binput_parse for print statements of hitran & auxiliary finle reads
   - reformatted tips to f90
   - lots of edited in tips_2017.f90 : combined commons and include files, edited big IF to a CASE,
      modified id numbers for SFIT after #21
   - initial test with x.co2.iso
   - TIPS processing is slow


-------------------


version v0.6 MP

- many bugfixes in the output files

new features

sfit4

- inclusion of the transmission curvature possible (fw.transmission = T)
- new lineshapes (Tran line shape, fw.lineshape = 4)
- line mixing first order (fw.lineshape = 4, fw.linemixing = T), only if line mixing data are available
- sdv lineshape (fw.lineshape = 4, fw.lineshape.sdv = T), only if sdv parameters are available
- absorbing layer in emission calculation (fw.emission=T, fw.continuum = T, see sfit4_init for more details)

hbin

- input files can be tag = value, old format is still read in too
- inclusion of additional line parameters (linemixing 1st order, line narrowing, additional parameters for pCqHDC lineshape)
