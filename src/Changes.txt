Notes for pre release versions V003.*

December 2013 Mathias Palm

- Appended DWNumShft, LineInt, LinePAir and LineTAir with the gasnames
  the entries apply to.
- Introduced a second molecule of HF (needed for HITRAN 2012)
- changed the match of extra parameters (line mixing, beta for
  Galatry, SDV parameters for CO as given in HITRAN 2012) from
  wavenumber to quantum numbers in hbin.f90.
  The Line mixing parameter file creatre by Frank Hase has been
  modified accordingly.
- kb matrices are calculated even if empirical apodisation and phase
  are not included into the forward model. Both functions are taken as
  a three dimensional function with the apriori value 1. 
- Added two more isotopes for HCL which appear in HITRAN 2012 with the
  isotopologue number 25 an 27. I guess this are DCL isotopes and
  assigned them the weigth 38 and 40 (the weigths of 15 and 17 plus 2
  for deuterium)


---------------------
July 2013
-commented out compile time variable in makefile passing to the version string
 this did not work with all compilers.  The code is there and can be re-arranged by a
 user if they like.  Affected files param.f90, rdrv40.f90, makefile.  No change in
 versions number.
- update character definitions remove *N to (len=N)
- add interface for galatry, betat and voigt in xsection.f90


---------------------
June 2013
- added isotopes 6,7,8 to N2O for ggg linelist
- changed XCS_DEBUG to XSC_DETAIL (was to be same switch anyway)


---------------------

---------------------
Mai 2013
- Introduced key kb.gas for calculation of Kb matrices for profile changes if gases are
  retrieved as a column.

General

Cleaned up definition of solar parameters.

sfit4.ctl

- added stop when an apriori covariance value found to be zero

sfit400.f90
-modified write out of KB so that the file does not contain the transposed Kb-matrix
-introduced TOBS_ORIG in order to reproduce RMS for KB run of forward
 model. The reason is a different normalisation schemes in sfit400.f90
 and fm.f90

frwdmdl.f90
-spectra by gas in type 2 only written if all parameters have been changed
-changed solar parameters so that apriori = 0.000 means use given value
-changed opd and fov parameters so that apriori = 0.000 means use given value
-corrected counting for modyifing SZSA
-spc.GAS ... ALL is not the sum of the spectra of the single spectra
- fixed a bug in calculating the solar spectra.

binput_parse_4.0.f90
- changed rt.iflm back to rt.lm. The key rt.iflm is not necessary and disagrees with the "philosophy"
  of the sfit4.ctl, besides all other retrieval keys have no if... key

writeout.f90
- changed tags in summary so that the naming os more consistent
- error matrix due to measurement error written out in out.level = 1


------------------------
Feb 2013 p1.5

-Fixed bug on the re-normalisation.
-Added prepspec (now pspec) to src directory to read sfit4.ctl bands
-Edited the input tags differentiating input and output files
-Separating switches for output from their re-naming
-Edited default names to be more descriptive
-Made several more arrays dynamic and cleaned up de-allocating them
-Put the version and runtime tag in the output files (not spc yet..)
-Put back the spc output code because I was searching out a bug in the output with
  multiple bands and scans for now (writes only once though when asking for final)
   - should but iterations in the same file i think
-Added band, scan and ngasb to each block in pbpfile at end of parameter block
-Made two identical output profile tables with z,p,t,airmass & vmr - one with all apriori
 (99) and one with retrieved so one reader reads them both & they are in table form - did
 not include SM error vectors, included airmass so partial column is right there.
-Kept statevec as it was and separated K.out
-Update some tags in sfit4.ctl

------------------------
Feb 2013 g1.1
merged g1.0 with mp 20130222
added AB.out


------------------------
Feb 2013 g1.0
merge MP 20130215 with m5.0
frwdmdl.f90 did not add yet new gasfile from mp since fix is already there and name change is ??
compiled!


------------------------
February 2013 Error Workshop
-Removed NMASS replaced with KVERT in sfit4.f90
-Fixed gasout error of multiple writes when requesting final

------------------------
December 2012 b3.999
-New version from MP diffed w/ 3.992
-Solar calc not right - shift  with the -1. isn't quite right
-change icfix to logical
-Fixed solar line shift
-Added solar line strength fit - be careful not recommended!
-Remove stop_criterion?? convergence for lm tol not

------------------------
Later October 2012 b3.992
MP Line mixing
diffed b3.991 with MP's "iter_error-lm/sfit_v003.97
added some checks for line shape model
added some printouts  too
fixed bug hbin: set sdv flag when should be lm flag
first tests: good - small improvement in rmsfit for 4880 co2 fit !!
lm + pres shift - amazing results
testcases:
x.o2.wlg
x.co2.iso

------------------------
Late October b3.991
spoke with GT, F- & S- need to use the same vmr
diff v003.99 & v003.95 lineparams.f90 & hbin.f90
improved pltfits.pro to work with GASFILES output
write gasout flags to detail
limit gasouttype to 1 || 2 only
clean up gasout formats in frwdmdl.f90
fixed nback error when no curve or slope fit nback was 0 and this does not crash but gives wrong result
testcases:
x.o2.wlg
x.co2.isotope
x.hcl.irwg.tab/03*
x.o3.irwg.tab/a
x.o2.nya

------------------------
October 2012 / Bremen
added O2 continuum, merged with hbin this is v003.95
hard coded in xsection.f90 and lineparam.f90 compensations since these lines are not
   standard hitran values
Added O2CIA as gas 49
see testcasex.o2/3.95 testcase from NJ/Darwin


------------------------
August 2012
Continue refining binary HITRAN creator/reader
Put binary/ascii flag in lineparam

install new line list reader
new input file hbin.input
remove all previous 'default' separated isotopes
49 hdo
53 ch3d
54 o3668:
55 o3686:
56 o3667:
57 o3676:

edit:
vibfcn.f90 - iso sep
molecparam.f90 - iso sep
bandparam.f90 - remove isotope sep
lineparam.f90- linfl -> tfil14
binput_parse_4_0.f90 - linfil -> tfile14
datafiles.f90 -> changed id of istope.input 21->9


create new program hbin.f90
   reads sfit4.ctl and makes a binary file xxxxx.ddd-xxxxx.ddd.hbin




------------------------
17 July 2012
new version 3.91 from copy of v003.90
Added band centers back into the isotope input file
edited: isotope.f90
Apparently a mistake/miscommuncation that it was removed...oops


------------------------
27 Jun 2012
initialize.f90:filse
made variable SNR into mean snr from all bands
bandparam.f90
SNR defined
frwdmdl.f90
put in ITER line as avgSNR
sfit4.f90
commented out CERR
commented out loop to lower SNR with negative vmrs



------------------------
25 Jun 2012

read_binput reads 'spectrum' block from sfit4.ctl but this *I think* is obsolete
input snr by band in the 'band' section
otherwise maybe put snr in t15asc file by band/spectrum - but too much for now

commented out snr in filse

but snr substitution by wavenumber is implemented in 'spectrum' section


------------------------
22 Jun 2012

convert_rdrv_394 /file : binput_4_0.f90
this is a real for item 7 was pointing to format for integer
write(11,1097) 'band.', nr, '.beam.', nr1, '.sa', '=', schan_scale(nr,nr1,1:4)*cciparm(nr,nr1,1:4)

comment out write isoflag - duplicate with ifiso?

Fundamentally for 99 molecules:
edited raytrace, galatry, vibfcn, molcparam for v003.90 / isotopes / 99 molec


------------------------
 20 Jun 2012
 zero shift inputs not right, see izero szero sa ...




------------------------
6 Jan 2011

still in 3.81

- Commented out creation of spectrum file from t15asc in convert_binput_394

- Added separate spectrum preparation code 'prepspec' / prepspec.inp




- added printout of FOVDIA and OMEGA
- OMEGA not being set?



-------------------------
v003.81
	- after all the meeting and fast changes.... try to get things under control
	- run convert_rdrv_394
		1. makes a sfit4.ctl from rdrv.ctl & binput
		2. makes a spectrum from t15asc *** dummy values for lat lon roe date & time
		3. add 70 to top of fasc.prf

		inputs are
			1. sfit4.ctl
			2. station.layers
			3. fasc.prf
			4. spectrum

		possibly
			1. ils.dat
			2. isotope.input
			3.
